Thanks! My son and me enjoyed the very well equipped kitchen and the espressomachine as well as the fast Wifi to check emails, touristinformation and searching for travelling day by day. Also the sleeping room and the bathroom are very nice and cosy. And there is a big advantage for tourists: You can wash your clothes with a good washing machine and drying with a good drying machine. Very well! The surrounding is not touristical, people are living and working there. Its normal Brooklyn. We liked it. The next subwaystation ist just a few minutes away to visit New York City, as well as the next supermarket for daily needings. The hospitality of Adam is a pleasure. And he is very uncomplicated and helpful. Thanks again for all!

It's very modern in decor and the bed was very comfortable!<br/>I felt very safe and secure in the apartment. There's a camera that you use to see and hear outside the front door. There is also a couch that can be converted into a nice size bed in the living room. My son slept over one night of my stay and it was perfect. <br/>I didn't use the trains so I can't comment on that, but used Uber a lot to get around easily. <br/>I walked 5 blocks to get my Dunkin Donuts coffee every morning and it was a nice walk. There is a corner store literally a few steps away which was super convenient for picking up little snacks and drinks. <br/>There is a washer/dryer in the unit so I was able to wash my clothes before I returned home!<br/>There is no air conditioning in the unit, but two nice fans in the bedroom kept it pretty cool. There's an extra box fan in the closet you could use in the front room if needed. <br/>The neighborhood is mixed with some very nice brownstones and some older ones. I wouldn't feel too safe walking alone at night because there are some \"iffy\" people out late, but I didn't have any problems. <br/>I would certainly recommend the place to anyone looking for a place to really feel like a local. <br/>Check in and out were self-managed which is nice. Lex left a welcome note on the counter which was a sweet touch. <br/>Compared to other AirBNBs I have used and/or considered, the cleaning fee is fairly high since you pretty much return the place to the condition you found it before you leave - wash all dishes, empty trash cans and put all linens/towels in the washer. Pretty standard check out rules, but usually half the cost at other places. <br/>I could see myself staying at this location again for sure for an even longer stay. While I was there, it felt like my place!"}, {"_id": "665e7a1681a877ddad0f104a", "date": "2017-09-04", "listing_id": "11139469", "id": "190596307", "reviewer_id": "57410964", "reviewer_name": "Cavelle", "comments": "Lex's place was very clean, warm an inviting.

We thought our stay went fine until we received an accusation from Lex and Raun for property damage and asking for more money. Let me just say this was my first AirBnB experience and definitely my last, this accusation put such a damp on my 9 day long vacation that I spent in New York. Overall the apartment was very clean the only issue I had was the bed had a bit of a strange smell, I overlooked it but after the second night it made my boyfriend and I itchy and gave me a rash on my face. Another issue I had was the extreme noise level. I understand that these are old buildings however it sounds like there are people inside the home, its quite scary if you are used to silence in a home. We heard minimal noise from Lex and Raun upstairs however, the sounds coming from neighbors, street was very loud. On our check out date, Lex and Rauns dog was barking outside at 7:30 AM for about 30 minutes straight.  Throughout our stay Lex and Raun only communicated with us once. It  was to inform us that he needed to go inside our apartment one of the days because there was an issue with the heater. We answered promptly and said that it was no issue. He never followed up with if they went inside the apartment or not. Unfortunately, this experience ended on a terrible note when we were accused of property damage on the coffee table and bed sheet. I usually don't write reviews but I felt it was important to notify guests of this scam they are doing to try to receive more money from our stay. We barely spent time inside the apartment. Most of our time was spent out. The coffee table was never used. I never sat at the table or even placed anything on it. We never even had a meal inside your home. So I know for a fact that these accusations are false because there is NO way a table can crack during our stay if we didn't even use it. We followed your check out procedures and thoroughly checked everything before we left. My boyfriend even went to the extent of mopping your floors. Trust me if the table or bed cover was damaged we would have noticed. We did everything that was asked of us and more. Again, I don't usually write reviews on anything but this was a truly unpleasant experience."}, {"_id": "665e7a1681a877ddad0f1057", "date": "2018-03-30", "listing_id": "11139469", "id": "248046871", "reviewer_id": "45554106", "reviewer_name": "Allison", "comments": "Lex and Raun were wonderful hosts.

Una sola habitaci\u00f3n muy adecuado para dos personas.<br/>Aspecto negativo solo destacar\u00eda uno y es la calefacci\u00f3n; en esta \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o las temperaturas son bajas y el apartamento no est\u00e1 bien aislado del exterior con lo que se hace necesario utilizar la calefacci\u00f3n continuamente pero el ruido de la misma es muy excesivo. Para dormir la temperatura de la habitaci\u00f3n puede bajar a menos de 12-13 grados cent\u00edgrados con lo que se hace necesario utilizar la calefacci\u00f3n pero entonces el descanso es imposible por el ruido que emite. De corregir este detalle la estancia seria ideal.<br/>A pesar de ello nuestra estancia ha sido estupenda y la recomendar\u00edamos; pocos d\u00edas antes de irnos Lex coloc\u00f3 adornos de navidad en nuestra puerta. Buen detalle. Feliz Navidad Lex y familia.<br/>12/08/2019 After 10 days in the apartment we can stand out.<br/>Positive aspects: good neighborhood at any time of the day even at night, very close to the subway (we preferably use the AC line), close to supermarkets where to be provided, the apartment in general very well equipped with basic needs (in the bathroom and kitchen) . A single room very suitable for two people.<br/>Negative aspect would only highlight one and it is the heating; At this time of the year the temperatures are low and the apartment is not well insulated from the outside, which makes it necessary to use the heating continuously but the noise is very excessive. To sleep the temperature of the room can fall below 12-13 degrees Celsius, which makes it necessary to use the heating, but then rest is impossible due to the noise it emits. If this detail is corrected, the stay would be ideal.<br/>Despite this, our stay has been great and we would recommend it; A few days before we left, Lex placed Christmas ornaments at our door.

The place was clean, neat and well decorated. It was exactly like the photos with several items having been reorganized and a few more additional items added. They provided everything from dish soap, bath soap, hand soap, shampoo, cotton buds, hairdryer! Thank you! There were only paper plates, but we did not cook, so it was fine (and less dishes to wash by hands). They had lots of kitchen gadgets though (coffee maker, blender, pots and pans) so technically, you can cook.<br/>We had an issue using the code provided to enter the place, but they called us within minutes to us sending them a message on airbnb! Truly appreciate the responsiveness! <br/>The home had everything we needed for our stay, we especially loved the fact it has in unit washer and dryer as we didn't want to bring too much clothes for the trip and we had a toddler with us. There was also a pack and play (we used for our toddler), a high chair, kids books and some toys too! We were very glad we reserved this place! <br/>Please note that if you're very sensitive to noise, you would hear foot steps and people moving around, opening and closing doors as the rental unit is a downstairs unit and the owners live upstairs. They didn't bother us much as we're not very sensitive to noise.<br/>We had to take the subway to Manhattan and the journey could take 40-50 minutes door to door, but it was manageable. The neighborhood was alright. The particular street where the property is located is clean and well lit at night, we never felt unsafe.  On our first night, we walked to Chez Oscar for dinner and some blocks leading to the restaurant felt sketchier, but there were lots of bodegas and local small hole in the wall restaurants (mostly takeouts) around and it felt very local which we also appreciate. <br/>If we're ever back to visit NYC, we won't hesitate to stay here again.

I have no doubt it will be a luxury apartment once all of the finishing renovation touches are complete. The neighbourhood is completely serviceable, with shops a short distance away. I don't entirely agree it is a 10 minute walk to the subway...maybe one terminal? However, the buses in the neighbourhood are very convenient and connect to the subways in a shorter time than it takes to walk.\r<br/>\r<br/>All of my interaction with Lamee was great...until we arrived. I initially booked his other space (2 br) and our booking was transferred to another unit in the same building at no additional charge. Looking at that unit, I saw it was 3 br. He informed me the stove and dishwasher may not be working when we stayed. This was acceptable given we would now have 3 bedrooms (a great addition given we were travelling with 2 teenagers). \r<br/>\r<br/>Upon arrival, I found only two bedrooms. I asked Lamee and was told the third was not available. And no, the stove and dishwasher were not working. So, in reality, I feel we were downgraded. I even looked on the listing during the week we were there and it still listed it as 3 bedrooms. Unfortunately, I did not realize you had to submit a complaint in the first 24 hours, or I would have. We were also short a blanket for one of the beds, that took a few days to be produced. \r<br/>\r<br/>Overall, it was a good stay, we made due with the circumstance and I do think this space will be a wonderful place to stay...just get all details clear and upfront beforehand."}, {"_id": "665e7a1681a877ddad0f0c02", "date": "2016-05-21", "listing_id": "11114607", "id": "75425559", "reviewer_id": "49110915", "reviewer_name": "Krystal", "comments": "Le logement de Lamee \u00e9tait parfait.

TV with satellite programming was nice for watching movies (with commercials) some nights. <br/>8. We liked the decor and style of the apartment. <br/>9. Plenty of sheets, blankets, and towels. <br/>CONS: <br/>The apartment was not the relaxing \"home base\" space we hoped it would be in NYC, due to finding badly stained furniture, stained walls and ceiling in the bedroom, many little details that created a negative experience, and lack of fresh airflow in the hot summer due to the fact that it is a basement apartment. The pictures of everything in the apartment being white and bright are misleading when confronted with the reality of the following: <br/>1. Old stained furniture. The sofa in the pictures is not the same one as what we found. There was a larger gray sofa with huge horrible stains on it. We didn't even want to sit on it. We covered it with a sheet right away. The bed in the bedroom was uncomfortable and made our backs hurt in the morning. It was an old mattress, because we could hear the springs creaking. The hosts want guests to take out their own trash and pile up their own bed linens and towels at the end of the stay. If we hadn't had to do that, I would not have discovered the shock of how horribly stained the mattress was! And there was no mattress cover, just a bare sheet on an old mattress. It was gross. <br/>2. Walls and ceiling. Brown water damage stains on the ceiling above the bed are not the nicest view when settling in for the night. The walls need a refresh as well, covered with spots and marks. Simply applying new paint in the bedroom would go a long way to improve guest experience. <br/>3. Small details of attention were lacking.  Many of the towels and handtowels are old and stained, although they smelled clean. The grout around the kitchen sink and between the shower tiles is stained black and could use a refresh. There were numerous used toiletries from previous guests piled up in the bathroom cabinets and two bars of previously used soap in the shower, instead of fresh unwrapped soap as one would expect. There was an old Brita pitcher in the refrigerator that looked gross. There are instructions for a DVD player, but no DVDs. There is an iron, but no ironing board. There was no nice flowering tree in the bathroom as in the pictures, there were no niceties at all to make a guest feel welcome or special. The back door was stuck and we were unable to open it; we thought it was bolted from the outside, but when I mentioned it to the hosts after our stay they told me that it wasn't and that I should have said something to them while we were there. With a bit more thought, like a note on the door that it sticks, we wouldn't have to ask the hosts about every little thing. There are just a bunch of little things that add up to being a not so great guest experience. It looks like the apartment has been run on automation for awhile. <br/>4. Having to ask for things that are included. The hosts were accommodating when I asked for things like a fan, recycle can liners, and paper products, and even some WD-40 because the bathroom door creaked so loudly that it would wake us up when anyone else went in there at night. (The WD-40 fixed that problem in one second.) However since the listing includes a fan, I found it a nuisance to have to ask for one. Our son slept in a hot front room the first night, because the air conditioner is only in the back bedroom. <br/>5. Noise. Bring earplugs - there is a major construction project down the street that creates loud booms and drilling noises during week days. The hosts live upstairs and wake up at 6-7am to bring their dog down to the backyard. They don't make more than reasonable noises, but anyone who's ever had an upstairs neighbor in an old apartment building can relate to the loud sound of footsteps above one's bed. During the night, it was very quiet, though! Surprisingly quiet for NYC. It's just early mornings that are the issue. The older fridge does make a rhythmic whirring noise that can be heard when it's quieter at night that I believe another guest mentioned, but it wasn't too bad for us, and can be blocked out with fan noise and ear plugs.<br/>6. The water pressure in the shower is some of the worst I have ever experienced. Don't forget to hold down the toilet handle for a full minute or the toilet won't flush. The old bidet attachment that doesn't work should just be removed from the toilet.<br/>7. We were given a warning to not run the air conditioner too much or we might be charged extra. For an apartment that says it includes AC, we found this off-putting. It was August.

The location is great. Lots of places to eat and Rite Aid is very close if you need anything. Private entry is convenient. <br/>My family and I were mostly out during the day and was only home to sleep. My dad and stepmom live 10 blocks away and this neighborhood is fantastic. I have been coming to Brooklyn to visit my dad since childhood and have experienced all seasons. I love love this neighborhood and I appreciate the history that comes with the buildings. <br/>With that said, I will share a few feedbacks that I had already shared with Samaa: <br/>1) we encountered cockroaches 2 of the nights we were there. Samaa did reassure us that she had an exterminator come out 3 weeks ago and was apologetic about it. I have shared with Samaa where I think the roaches were coming from and she is having the company come out again. <br/>2) the stained/dirty couch - there are extra bedding you can use to cover it up so you can sit down. Samaa does plan to take care of the couch when she gets a chance in between tenants.<br/>3) dirty water/Brita pitcher from previous guest - Samaa is also already aware of this <br/>4) used condiments/used toiletries - it is there for convenience but my family and I brought our own since we were not comfortable using other peoples items. But if you didn\u2019t bring any, the toiletries are there for your convenience. <br/>5) The one thing I did forget to bring up with Samaa during our stay (since my mind was mainly on the roaches) was the smoke detector being detached or not firmly attached to the wall. I hope it was working during our stay."}, {"_id": "665e7a1681a877ddad0f0bf2", "date": "2022-08-25", "listing_id": "11100541", "id": "701474921998075016", "reviewer_id": "12514915", "reviewer_name": "Jen", "comments": "Great location, easy checkin/checkout."}, {"_id": "665e7a1681a877ddad0f0bf3", "date": "2022-09-04", "listing_id": "11100541", "id": "708713124525435389", "reviewer_id": "10798730", "reviewer_name": "Jens", "comments": "Samaa\u2018s apartment has been great to explore Brooklyn and all of New York!

The Flat is very cute and cosy. We had some issues:<br/>- the bed is not a twin bed as described. You can\u2019t really sleep two people on it comfortably and the camping bed doesn\u2019t have a mattress. Not ideal for couples and if you are recovering from jet lag.<br/>- as you are sleeping near the kitchen, you can smell a lot of gas from the stove. It\u2019s quite normal for nyc, as Natalie told us, but it can be quite annoying to smell all the time. <br/>- because of the gas you have to keep the window open, which means it is quite noisy and sometimes difficult to sleep. I used ear plugs. But again it\u2019s a bit annoying.<br/>-the house in general is clean and tidy, but there is some dust around in the corners and on furniture.<br/>The flat is in a great location, I loved it.

I arrived late because of traffic after 8 hours drive, and Natalie was still waiting for us, many thanks for that. But when she left and we started getting familiar with the property, things got worse - dog and human hair everywhere, dust and insects shells by the bed and on a nightstand lamp, dirty floors, ants running across the room, chair partially eaten (by the dog I assume) and fixed with scotch tape. Screams, rat squeaks, police sirens and noise from passing train - through the window that was advised to stay open because of the gas stove, just in case. Me and my wife had to run from there to a hotel one hour after check-in and we returned keys next day. Airbnb decided that I left no chance to the host to fix the situation (why I have to explain to the host that \"clean and cozy\" is the opposite of what was there) and refused to return full amount. It seems like it was the last booking through Airbnb and I don't recommend this property to anyone."}, {"_id": "665e7a1681a877ddad0f0c2c", "date": "2018-10-27", "listing_id": "11117439", "id": "341714310", "reviewer_id": "139303746", "reviewer_name": "Charlie", "comments": "We had a really good time in this studio; it was comfortable, clean and quirky.

If you cook or need supplies, there was also a Target one block down the street. Even though this apt is only a block or two from all this, it was very quiet. The bedrooms face an interior courtyard, so we were able to sleep in every morning. The only downside of the apt was a lack of A/C, making afternoons there a bit hot/humid. Other than that, it was perfect. Marta, our host, made the entire experience very easy (check-in, check-out) and was very communicative. As far as NYC experiences go- staying in this apt is a must!

We stayed for 3 nights with two small kids. \r<br/>Our trips into Manhatten were easy with subways just 2 mins walk away. The convenience was crucial given that we stayed during NY's heatwave. So the short time spent commuting and the easy walk was a super plus for our 5 year old.\r<br/>We enjoyed 2 cafes: Building on Bond (Boerum Hill) and Smooch (Fort Greene), and went to multiple parks in Prospect Park and Fort Greene, hanging out with other parents and nannys so we felt like real locals. If you have small kids and intend to visit parks in the summer, take swimmers so they can play in the kid's fountains.\r<br/>\r<br/>The apartment was roomy and pleasant, and we felt at home straight away. Something that did not bother us but could be good to know is that the place gets pretty warm with no A/C. However this week has been unusually warm (today 36C/97F) so this may have just been exceptional circumstances. The building's entrance hallway is ugly but it added to the NY experience! It was also quickly forgotten as soon as you step into Marta's place.\r<br/>Marta was very responsive, helpful and friendly. \r<br/>We loved our brief stay in NY thanks to the relaxing apartment after 12 hour long days out and about in the city. \r<br/>Thank you Marta!"}, {"_id": "665e7a1581a877ddad0c32cc", "date": "2015-08-02", "listing_id": "1114409", "id": "40861342", "reviewer_id": "39875238", "reviewer_name": "Shi", "comments": "Marta's place situates in a charming neighborhood only minutes away from Barclays Center subway station, a major stop in Brooklyn that can take you to most parts in Manhattan and uptown.

The hallway could use a sweep, and the apartment itself is typical of older buildings, woodwork painted over multiple times, etc.\r<br/>\r<br/>Folks in the apartment on the first floor with access to the courtyard sat outside both nights and talked loudly and played music. It was most egregious Saturday night, in which they were out until midnight, then went back out again at 3 a.m., then again at 10 a.m. Sunday morning. Because both bedrooms face the courtyard, and because, due to the heat, we wanted the windows open, this meant a night of disrupted sleep. Our only solution was to close the windows and blast the air conditioner, but the noise was still present. Marta did apologize and said it was unusual, but it seems if the people downstairs have access to a courtyard, they would use it frequently."}, {"_id": "665e7a1581a877ddad0c32d0", "date": "2015-12-21", "listing_id": "1114409", "id": "57068314", "reviewer_id": "7430969", "reviewer_name": "Beth", "comments": "Marta's Brooklyn brownstone apartment is darling and has a lot of personality!

Is it in a nice and calm street , and at the same time everything is in five minutes walk. Subway lines are just right there,  that takes you everywhere. A lot of 24hours markets in 2 minute walk. So the area is perfect!!! Check is and check out is also vesy smooth , self check in-very comfortable. Regarding the apartment, is it a very old building, so aprtment as well , and is it full of Martas personal items , so there is not space for your staff at all. You can only use one small wardrobe that  is not enough for even one person. Due to a lot of personal staff , staying there is very unconfotable, lot of books makes lots of dust, and if you have any type of alerty that is not place for you. The biulding had some problem on the period we stayed there.There was an awfull smell in one of the bedrooms, i informed Marta( she was not in US) she comfirmed that other neighbours also claimed and promised  to figure it out with ,  but nothing has happened, so one of us had to sleep on a sofa, which is not comfortable at all and one had to sleep in a small bedroom with a kid:(  Very sad.

A vacuum and cleaning supplies were even provided.<br/>The views from the balcony are lovely and the space is so bright and airy.

The flat is one of the nicest I imagine you can stay in when visiting Brooklyn.

If for some reason you just felt the need to stay inside for the day, you have your pick of smart TV or 100+ books to choose from. I personally felt it irresistible to stay indoors being that Brooklyn is such an eclectic borough. <br/>The amount of shops and restaurants just within a 10 minute walk was dizzying to keep up with, even during COVID times and limited capacity.

I forgot to ask for extra sheets for the pullout as I assumed they would be there, and Shully assumed I was staying by myself. \r<br/>When my 2nd guest and I returned from the city around 11:30 pm the host was asleep and I realized we had no sheets or pillows or blanket for the pullout. I texted the host but had no response as she and her husband were asleep (as most working parents would be) and had to give my blanket to my brother who slept on the couch cushions. Shully offered the sheets etc. immediately upon waking up the next morning. She came down at check out and apologized and asked if we were ok. Which we were, and all was well. I have suggested leaving extras in the empty closet in the Master. \r<br/>\r<br/>Despite this little bump in the road, Shully was extremely accomodating and pleasent. \r<br/>\r<br/>I would reccommend this as a nice place to stay and crash, but the commute to the city is about 20 min via a commuter train. The train is $6.50 each way. The station is 4 blocks south of the house and 2 blocks west. It took me 10 minutes to walk to it. \r<br/>I arrived just as the train was pulling away and had to wait another 25 min until the next arrived, so factor that into your time to get into the city as well. \r<br/>\r<br/>The area was cute and safe. \r<br/>\r<br/>Overall I enjoyed my stay!

A lot of space, nicely furnished, clean, comfortable bed and she even provided breakfast items, juice and soda. We met her when we checked out and she was really nice! I would definitely stay here again! Thanks for a great stay Shully!!"}, {"_id": "665e7a1681a877ddad0f0deb", "date": "2017-05-14", "listing_id": "11138823", "id": "152008297", "reviewer_id": "124298668", "reviewer_name": "Aaron", "comments": "Shully is the definition of a SUPERHOST. From start to finish, she cared for my lady and I like we were her family. I hope that she has availability every time we need to travel to NYC because I have no desire to stay anywhere else. The apartment was clean, everything worked, she was responsive if/when we needed anything and it felt so good to be around great energy for the duration of our stay. Thank you Shully for your kind heart and for the awesome experience. Looking forward to next time.

It was a welcomed surprise since we got in super late and had no time to pick up anything to eat. Initially, I was a little worried because she had to be out of the country due to a death in the family however, she quickly addressed any request or hiccup we had. Honestly, we couldn\u2019t have been better taken care by her and her assistants.  <br/>As for the apartment, it is situated in a quiet clean neighborhood close to Metro North and the subway. It was easy to get into Manhattan or go north for a different kind of experience. And when I wanted to stay closer to home, there was a market nearby where I was able to buy fresh fish and vegetables. Although the oven was not operational I was able to make do with the electric grill and panini maker provided. I enjoyed cooking in this small kitchen because unlike home everything was at my fingertips which reminded me that bigger is not always better. <br/> <br/>To sum it up, if you are looking for a clean, comfortable, well attended, conveniently located spot, Shully\u2019S is the place!<br/>"}, {"_id": "665e7a1681a877ddad0f0edc", "date": "2018-08-18", "listing_id": "11138823", "id": "309652279", "reviewer_id": "107289372", "reviewer_name": "Tammy", "comments": "First the positives...

My plane arrived in New York at 12:30 am and Ms. Shully was very understanding! Her husband waited up until I arrived at the Airbnb to make sure I was safe and secure. The bed was huge and extremely comfortable and the apartment itself is very nice and neat. Ms. Shully and her husband stocked the refrigerator with sodas, water, eggs, bread among other goodies needed in case you get hungry. The microwave was extremely fast and efficient. The bathroom was stocked with Scott tissue, Hand-soap, Febreeze as well as Ol of Olay body wash, shampoos and conditioner. These luxuries hotels don\u2019t even offer. <br/>Ms. Shully in my opinion was far better the any hotel I was soooooo comfortable and I felt right at home. New York it a nutshell is very cold but Ms. Shully Airbnb was so warm with heaters in each room. The last day I was able to relax outside of work and watch TV and just enjoy myself on my last day. The other thing I can say is Ms. Shully and her husband were very supportive and assisted me with the utmost respect and care.

The location is pretty convenient - within walking distance of several bus stops and the 7 train. It was also a couple blocks from a cluster of grocery stores and mini markets. The room looked exactly like it did in the picture and it was very clean and bright. Having the private bathroom was a huge plus. I hadn't realized that there were other long-term residents living in the house, but I did not have any interactions with them beyond a passing \"hello\". I arrived 2 hours later than I had originally planned due to train and bus delays, but the guy who met me with the key was very nice about it and didn't give me a hard time, so that was very much appreciated."}, {"_id": "665e7a1681a877ddad0f12a9", "date": "2016-04-21", "listing_id": "11186765", "id": "70894852", "reviewer_id": "9546073", "reviewer_name": "Rachna", "comments": "This was a very clean and private room. The attached bathroom was MAJOR key.  Jose was very responsive and accommodated an extra night stay at the last minute. My only critique would be that it says in description that the subway station is 3 blocks away but they are VERY long blocks. It's a solid 10 minute walk to subway if u walk briskly.  It would be good knowing that beforehand so so you can make a decision accordingly. Also the walls are quite thin so u can hear people walking upstairs quite loudly sometimes late at night. Luckily I always travel with ear plugs so It didn't bother me but it would have been an issue if I didn't have them. But  otherwise I found the bed very comfortable and I never saw any of the other people in the house. It's great for the price.

Jose had Ernesto take care of making sure I was okay and knew where everything went. Then, gloriously, I was left completely alone to explore the city! The room was mostly quiet, with limited conversations/basketball games through the window, but nothing more than normal street noise in general. \r<br/>\r<br/>The bed was clean and comfortable, the desk was just the right size to get some real writing done, there was lots of closet space, a nice little shower and bathroom, and I even found a bunch of travel amenities in the upper drawer of the dresser. \r<br/>\r<br/>Given the price for this room, I would stay here every single time I visit New York City in the future, if it were possible. It's a nice 0.6 mile, 10 minute walk down the street to the MTA, and there is tons of food within easy walking distance - even a weekend street market where folks come out to sell their wares and food. \r<br/>\r<br/>The lighting in the room was good, and I also felt safe and private in the evening and when walking around the neighborhood. When I was finished visiting, I told Jose - and I will tell you - that staying in this room made me consider moving to NYC from the Bay Area. What you see is what you get, and what you get is incredible value at this place in Queens.\r<br/>\r<br/>I even asked for a late checkout if I cleaned up the room, which I tried to do as well as I could, and it was not a problem at all. Of course, your mileage may vary on this according to Jose's occupancy. \r<br/>\r<br/>I will look for this AirBNB first next time I visit New York. I recommend you try it, too. But not when I want to travel. ;)\r<br/>\r<br/>"}, {"_id": "665e7a1681a877ddad0f12ac", "date": "2016-05-04", "listing_id": "11186765", "id": "72784565", "reviewer_id": "68922901", "reviewer_name": "Shams Ur", "comments": "Lived in Jose place for 3 days.

I had a wonderful most caring host, Jose, who made sure that I and my brother will have a satifying stay in his place.<br/>From the moment I requested booking in and throughout outdelightful stay we had constant communication where Jose gave me useful information from coming from the airport, finding his house, getting around the quiet and safe neighbourhood, advising the most convenient way to get to Manhattan, places to eat, etc. When we came which was earlier than expected, we were let in by Ernesto who was as helpful as Jose and Emerson who made us feel as though we've known each other for a long time, that was very reassuring for us that this is the place to be.<br/>The room was bigger than I thought and had an ensuite. We had clean towels, linen, toilettries, etc. There' nothing more you could ask for. <br/>Another plus to write about is the assistance Jose afforded us when we needed to extend as we had a problem with our tour to Canada. Again he came to our rescue offering us to stay another 2 days. There was no hassle at all. Everything went smoothly.<br/>To sum it up, this was an ecperience never to be missed, hospitable, friendly, caring host and a eonderful place to stay close to redtaurants, shops, pharmacies, groceries, laundromat, the metro and buses; what could you ask for? I hope someone reading this would consider staying at Jose's place as I highly recommend this. Once again thank you Jose, Ernesto and Emerson, you are all wonderful people!

I often came back late but felt quite safe walking back at night. Check-in and check-out was easy and hassle-free. My only complaint is that during my first night there I could hear very loud footsteps coming from the room right above me, for a good forty minutes, and someone seemed to be dragging things around. I let Martin know and he responded quickly. The following nights I could still hear footsteps, but the sound lasted for a much shorter time and didn't bother me anymore.

I'll try to sort this out by category. >>> Price and value: Given Airbnb's variable \"Smart Pricing,\" I lucked into a great price. For example, I just checked the cost of several different stays here over the coming year. The daily rates ranged from about 50% more than what I paid to about three times. Of course, everyone has a different perception of what constitutes good value. >>> Location: This would be the main reason I'd come back. It's an easy half-mile walk from the 7 Line (the listing says seven minutes, but that's only if you're moving really, really fast) for a quick trip into Manhattan or to Citi Field.  There's also a bus a half block away that will take you to two other stations on the line -- one with an elevator -- in about 10-15 minutes, depending on traffic. Another bus at that stop will take you to Williamsburg, in Brooklyn. Also within walking distance is a remarkable multi-national assortment of restaurants and shops. (Don't miss de Mole.) And within a few stops on the 7 Line are even more restaurants and shops, a few museums in Queens, plus access to the LIRR. The neighborhood is safe and quiet; no worries there at all. >>> Bedroom/bathroom: The mattress was a very comfortable medium-firm Tempurpedic. As you can see in the pictures, there's a ton of dresser and closet space. It was a nice shower, with plenty of hot water. Great towels, but no washcloth. The older in-wall a/c was loud but worked well. As with most older houses, you could hear footsteps from upstairs, but it was quiet from about 10 pm to 7 am. (And, fortunately, the other two occupants on my floor were reasonably quiet.) The headboard and dresser were stylish, but there was just a folding table and folding chair (not the office chair that's in the pictures) to use as a desk. There's a simple doorknob lock for when you're in the room. A dedicated key lock would have been better, but I was told NYC doesn't allow that. The walls were completely bare except for a construction mark. >>> Cleanliness: Generally OK, but a few slips made this four stars instead of five. There was some debris on the plush bath mat, so clearly it hadn't been carefully vacuumed or shaken out. The a/c filter was very dirty. (I cleaned it.) The bathroom exhaust fan also looked dirty. (I didn't clean it, but it's probably clean by now.) The other occupants were somewhat lax at cleaning up after themselves in the kitchen, but things improved after I mentioned this to the caretaker Ernesto. >>> Communication: Generally good. I recommend using Airbnb messaging to communicate with Jose, if needed. (And definitely download the Airbnb app.) Ernesto was helpful, but his command of English wasn't always the best. Also, on one occasion, while I was in the bedroom with the door unlocked and closed, he knocked but started to enter before I had a chance to respond. Obviously I didn't appreciate the intrusion. >>> Other stuff: Do be sure to read all of the House Rules before you request a booking. I certainly understand and support the concerns about safety, cleanliness, etc., and I know that some guests can try to take advantage of a host's hospitality, but a few of the rules sounded more like a hostel's than an Airbnb's -- for example, $10 for an extra set of towels or $15 for extra bed linens. I'm very neat and leave a small footprint, so I decided to go ahead with the booking anyway."}, {"_id": "665e7a1681a877ddad0f130f", "date": "2019-12-12", "listing_id": "11186765", "id": "576150256", "reviewer_id": "128084297", "reviewer_name": "Victoria", "comments": "A grandes rasgos dir\u00eda que es un sitio en el que se pueden pasar unas noches sin esperar grandes lujos. <br/>Est\u00e1 a unos 12 minutos caminando del metro y con la linea 7 llegas a Manhattan en unos 20 min aprox. <br/>Es un primer piso de una casa antigua con tres habitaciones.

The fact that it is the entire basement means that the area available is huge (though tall people need to mind their head: low ceilings)! The price it's listed at is an absolute steal for what you get -- you will find it difficult to find hotel/motel rooms and Airbnb listings offering this kind of value.<br/>Beyond just the apartment itself, Douglas has obviously put a lot of work into making other aspects of the stay great as well. For those here mainly to see the sights, Douglas has prepared materials instructing guests on getting to and around the city, as well as tips for places to visit. And for those looking to feel more at home, there is a full kitchen with an oven and stove and waffle maker; some breakfast materials are included like oatmeal and waffle mix (we did have some difficulty locating utensils--they were in a somewhat-hard-to-find drawer in the dining table). Yes, we made waffles. International guests will be happy to find a few converter plugs lying around near power sockets.<br/>Also included is a very large array of DVDs for guests' viewing pleasure. A nice personal touch: I told Douglas we were going to watch a few Broadway musicals, and were happily amused to find a copy of the movie version of Chicago already in the DVD player waiting for us."}, {"_id": "665e7a1681a877ddad0f1635", "date": "2017-06-07", "listing_id": "11194693", "id": "158635646", "reviewer_id": "42900182", "reviewer_name": "Jamie", "comments": "Doug's place is a great option when traveling to the city on a budget. The unit was exactly as pictured/described and fit our every need. The beds and futons were quite comfortable. Doug was a great host who went out of his way to ensure that we had as best of a trip as possible. He provided a bottle of wine at check-in and some great recommendations. The area was convenient to the city, but as three mid-20 year old ladies we did feel unsafe at times while walking to the subway. Although not enough to deter us from staying at Doug's unit again. The cost savings on the unit greatly surpass the costs of calling a lyft back instead of taking the subway. Our lyft cost from Times Square was around $32. I'd also recommend taking the subway uptown and then calling the lyft. We did this a few times and it cut the lyft cost in 1/2. Overall great stay!!"}, {"_id": "665e7a1681a877ddad0f1636", "date": "2017-06-10", "listing_id": "11194693", "id": "159315134", "reviewer_id": "6382700", "reviewer_name": "Christiane", "comments": "The apartment is well appointed to provide guests with all they need.

My bed was super comfortable and I slept very well every night.  In the morning the coffee helped us get started for our day (and late night) exploring Manhattan and Brooklyn.<br/>I was very happy with the location of the apartment (in a brownstone)...just a couple of blocks from a big super market and a very short walk to the subway (with great connections to downtown Manhattan).  Since we arrived by car I was worried about parking, but was relieved that it was quite easy and convenient.<br/>Douglas and his family are great and very caring hosts and I recommend their place to anyone who needs a quiet and comfortable sanctuary after a long day in the Big Apple.  <br/>Vielen, vielen Dank!<br/>Tip!  If in NYC for a few days, get the Metro Card for 7 days (ca. 30 bucks)...it's well worth it to explore Manhattan and Brooklyn with unlimited rides.  We also used the air-conditioned public bus system (also part of Metro Card) in Brooklyn for our sightseeing endeavors."}, {"_id": "665e7a1681a877ddad0f1637", "date": "2017-06-26", "listing_id": "11194693", "id": "164171103", "reviewer_id": "50137740", "reviewer_name": "Rebekah", "comments": "Douglas and his family were great hosts!

Very helpful and accommodating, and throughout our stay was always available to help and answer any of our questions. The apartment is basically the basement of Doug's family home, with a flight of steps above leading to the rest of the house. The room, bedroom, kitchen and shower is open plan, separated by wardrobes and a divider at the bottom of the bed (which we moved and placed back upon leaving, both because it obscures the view of the TV from the bed, and because it actually makes the living quarters more open and generally nicer looking). There is pretty much everything you could possibly need in the apartment, oven/grill, microwave, iron & ironing board etc, plus a little outside area which we used to occasionally dry clothes - although there seems to be a slight issue with the reception of the cable TV, making it difficult to watch a full programme. Being a basement, there's maybe a slight amount of damp within, which is apparent from slight scent upon entering and nearer to the shower area, but there are dehumidifiers to help combat this. This aside, the apartment was very nice and warm, even during the night, which was a great combination with the very comfy bed there! We did however have quite a few problems sleeping due to certain amount of noise. The microwave made a repetitive beeping throughout the night and displayed a message that the appliance required a service. We advised Doug of this and was told that the microwave was fine but that the previous guests may have set an alarm on it for when we were there. We were able to unplug this, and turn off the humidifier during the night, but the noisy fridge and the house boiler (which being in the basement is basically situated in the same room) were more of problem to deal with. I slept with ear plugs, but this still failed to drown out the loud humming and banging of the boiler. Wanting to explore NYC at night and returning late, we found ourselves with very little sleep during our stay. We did advise of the boiler noise and Doug's wife did offer to take a look at it, but as we stressed, the problem is not that it's broken - quite the opposite. The main downside of apartment is its location. New York's transport system is quite a bit behind that of other big cities, and although a daytime Metro journey into Manhattan is quite convenient (if the trains are running that day, or if the station isn't closed - we had to walk a further 20-25 mins on occasions), if you're wanting to return back later in the evening it can take a very long time to return back on the local trains (if they're running).

When we arrived, Tom took all the time to show us the whole house and explain how devices we are not used to have at home should work. He also showed us a map with supermarket, subway station and a lot of flyers with free-delivery dining places. We told him about our plans and he gave us important tips and pieces of advice. They also left some kitchen stuff in the house, such as many kinds of spices, butter, coffee, sugar, flour, detergent. When we got sick because of the cold weather, they even brought a bag with ginger tea and hot chocolate, which was extremely kind. The location was very good, with one great supermarket only two blocks away and one subway station four blocks away, which has 2 lines that go directly to Manhattan all the time in approx. 15 minutes. The neighborhood is quite safe until 10 p.m. and after that it is very cheap to take an Uber/Lyft from 149 th - Grand Concourse station, which costs around $10 and is very close to a shopping mall. It was very worth it to stay a little bit away from Manhattan to avoid noisy and crowded places and also save up for shopping and other attractions.

Good initial stocking in the kitchen/bathroom. <br/>Cons: Mattress is not the newest and slightly sinks. Not a problem, just a \"nit\" (not very important) . Couch isn't the most comfortable on, but still fine, it might lack some extra pillows. During the summer, if windows are open, there's a back bar patio right next to it so I can see the noise from it maybe being an issue.

My wife was very nervous about our first AirBNB, she likes everything to be clean.  She loved it.  I don't think the host lives in this place she just rents it out.  This is nice because my wife did not want to sleep in some ones apartment with all their stuff in it.  The beds were very comfortable. \r<br/>The location is great.  The train, the Whole Foods, the park, all just a block away. We were able to get everywhere from Coney Island to Times Square to the Ferry on direct lines on the train 1 block away.  This worked really well.  We did a lot in the 4 days in the City.\r<br/>I could not believe we could this much space in Manhattan for this price.  I priced the hotels and this place was much better.  It also a kitchen and washer dryer which we used.\r<br/>I had to bring my car into the City for 1 night and there was plenty of spots within 1 block which was nice.\r<br/>I am looking forward to another New York trip so we can book this place again.\r<br/>The host was very accommodating to our needs.

The apartment looked exactly like the photos, except for the outdoor area which unfortunately we ended up not using anyway due to the constant loud humming noise coming from air conditioners and generators from surrounding apartments. The apartment is on the ground floor so at times it felt like we were underground with little to no natural light - which can get depressing at times but won't be an issue to most people - you're in New York City and will probably be out exploring anyway. We had an issue with the apartment's cleanliness - hair, dust, trash, etc....there was even broken glass under the living room couches.

The bed was comfortable and we were able to watch TV on the bed which was very relaxing as well.

In fact, quite a few. Some you may have to walk a few minutes (10 minutes more or less) if you want to go to the nearest Stop N Shop and what have you but otherwise, lots of markets in the area.<br/>15-20 minutes walking, 10 minutes or less running, 5 minutes biking, 2-5 minutes in a car to the beach. Not bad!<br/>Multiple train stations in the area, many buses in the area. <br/>The studio apartment is quaint and cute. The bar is a nice touch and is cool if you want to drink by yourself or with your partner/friend(s).  The studio apartment is a great size for no more than two people. 3 is squeezing it in. For one person its perfect and just right. Nice little kitchen that's functional. Fire escape with a view of the courtyard, with lots of trees and good for people watching. Comfortable bed, good natural sun light in the room.<br/>Quiet area but the main drag can be a bit noisy but luckily you're not facing that way.<br/>Valentina was very prompt and helpful with directions on how to get the key. Answered any questions I had.<br/>Some cons (not a big deal though):<br/>-The place can get a bit hot if there's no breeze. Thankfully there IS an A/C. If you're like me and not an AC person, it can be annoying to use an AC but there was sometimes where it got very hot and muggy and I hate to put on the AC. And the AC is a bit loud. However, this is NOT a deal breaker for me, I can live.<br/>VERDICT: Definitely recommend staying here. Great area of Brooklyn to explore, lots of cool eateries, the beach not far away, not far from Downtown Brooklyn and can get to midtown Manhattan no more than 45 minutes (from the Q or D trains). Valentina was pleasure. Overall very good place.

The place itself has everything we needed (stayed there over the holidays and were able to cook our meal & such without issue). It got a bit hot at times, but was easily and quickly remedied by opening a few windows. It was also noisy as some commented, but we (incl our son) quickly grew accustomed to it.

The location near Little Italy and Soho was second to none with a huge range of eating and shopping options on her doorstep and all around the immediate neighbourhood. Subway access was within a 2 minute walk. Our parents stayed uptown and were jealous of the options in our neighbourhood.<br/>Whilst the apartment is compact there are two separate bedrooms with a separate lounge and very functional kitchen. The apartment temperature was always comfortable and so we were able to co-habitate without living on top of each other. Bathroom has bath and shower which was great after a long flight from Australia.<br/>Sky was very welcoming with her legendary cup cakes from one of the great sweet option on the same street.<br/>The only item to be aware of is that the apartment is on the top floor with quite a few stairs so no problem for an able bodied person but something to be conscious of if you are not able to deal with many stairs.<br/>Truly grateful for being able to experience NYC first hand and would happily return to Sky's place if I am back in NYC.
